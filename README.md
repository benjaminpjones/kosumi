# Kosumi[1.0]: a Go Library
Parses SGF into an array of javascript objects. It's a work in progress as I learn the basics of JavaScript and programming in general. 

I'd like to create a Game class to store parsed SGF files, but I'm still figuring out how classes work in Javascript. Right now, the functions in parse.js can handle any Go SGF I've thrown at them!!

## To-do list:
- Learn about error handling
- Implement classes - a general Game class, or a different class for each game supported by SGF? 
- Implement game logic >.>
- Clean up... everything............ the code is so messsyyyyyy

I started over from scratch a few days ago, but I'm leaving in the original sgf-parse.js as sgf-parseDEPRECATED.js so i can look back and appreciate my progress :D
